# Python_API_Challenge

For this challenge, there were two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy. The most frustrating part of this activity is when I had the API calls incorrect and I would receive the error message for that. I honestly did not understand a majority of the error message, so I would break down the code in pieces to see where it was wrong. I did this so many times, I lost count. When I would be throughly frustrated and close to giving up, I reached out to my tutor, as well as AskBCS. This enabled me to understand what parts of my code were incorrect, as well as giving me knowledge on the "why" part of my code not working.

## WeatherPy
This one was a bit tricky for me. I had the randomized locations down quickly, but I was unable to store all the information necessary for the DataFrame. I would run the function over and over again, but to no avail. This also led to my key being blocked for a period of time, as I had gone over the request limit more than a few times. When I finally could try the requests again, I reached out to my tutor, as well as AskBCS. I could finally understand why the information wasn't retained and why my DataFrame would display the last city's information, over the entire 700+ rows.

## VacationPy
This one was quite easy for me in the beginning, as importing the data I had created from the previous part was a no-brainer. Also, the parsing down of the data to find my ideal vacation locations was simple. It was then when I proceeded to struggle. My API calls would not work for the locations, as before in the WeatherPy activity. Again I found out that I was missing little parts of syntax before I had the information I required. The mapping was relatively easy after that.
